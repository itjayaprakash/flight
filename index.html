							<div class="pol-desc">
								<p>As you may already be aware the General Data Protection Regulation comes into force on 25 May 2018. This legislation places greater obligations on companies not only in terms of how they process personal data, but also to ensure individuals are fully informed about the processing of their data that takes place.</p>
								<p>This legislation applies to all companies who are based in the European Union or who process the personal data of individuals who live in the European Union. It accordingly has important implications for the entirety of the Integra group.</p>
								<p>Integra Software Services Private Ltd. (“Integra”) is committed to protecting the privacy and security of personal information.</p>
								<p>It is essential that all employees of Integra, wherever they are based, comply with the terms of our Global Data Protection Policy.
